<h2>ZF2010-02: Potential XSS vector in Zend_Dojo_View_Helper_Editor</h2>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

<p>
    <code>Zend_Dojo_View_Helper_Editor</code> was incorrectly decorating a TEXTAREA
    instead of a DIV. The Dojo team has reported that this has security
    implications as the rich text editor they use is unable to escape
    content for a TEXTAREA. 
</p>

<h3>Action Taken</h3>

<p>
    The primary rationale in Zend Framework for using a TEXTAREA
    with the Editor Dijit was to allow for graceful degradation in browser 
    environments that do not support JavaScript. The component has been reworked 
    such that we now decorate an HTML DIV, and provide a separate TEXTAREA 
    within a NOSCRIPT tag for purposes of graceful degradation; content is 
    escaped in the latter TEXTAREA. 
</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>
    If you use <code>Zend_Dojo_View_Helper_Editor</code>, it is strongly
    recommended that you upgrade to either the latest available
    Zend Framework release, or one of the following releases, immediately:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li>1.9.7</li>
    <li>1.8.5</li>
    <li>1.7.9</li>
</ul>
