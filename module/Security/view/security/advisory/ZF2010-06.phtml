<h2>ZF2010-06: Potential XSS or HTML Injection vector in Zend_Json</h2>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

<p>
    <code>Zend_Json_Encoder</code> was not taking into account the solidus 
    character ("/") during encoding, leading to incompatibilities with the 
    JSON specification, and opening the potential for XSS or HTML injection
    attacks when returning HTML within a JSON string.
</p>

<h3>Action Taken</h3>

<p>
    <code>Zend_Json_Encoder</code> was patched to escape the solidus character 
    when encoding PHP strings to JSON.
</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>
    This particular vulnerability only affects those users who are either (a) 
    using <code>Zend_Json_Encoder</code> directly, (b) requesting native encoding 
    instead of usage of ext/json (e.g., by enabling the static 
    <code>$useBuiltinEncoderDecoder</code> property of <code>Zend_Json</code>), 
    or (c) on systems where ext/json is unavailable (e.g. RHEL, CentOS). If you 
    are affected, we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest available Zend 
    Framework release, or one of the following releases, immediately.
