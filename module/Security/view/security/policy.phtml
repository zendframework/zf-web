    If you have encountered a potential security vulnerability in Zend 
    Framework, please report it to us at <a 
        href="mailto:zf-security@zend.com">zf-security@zend.com</a>. We will 
    work with you to verify the vulnerability and patch it.

    When reporting issues, please provide the following information:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Component(s) affected</li>
    <li>A description indicating how to reproduce the issue</li>
    <li>A summary of the security vulnerability and impact</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We request that you contact us via the email address above and give the 
    project contributors a chance to resolve the vulnerability and issue a new 
    release prior to any public exposure; this helps protect Zend Framework 
    users and provides them with a chance to upgrade and/or update in order to 
    protect their applications.

<h2>Policy</h2>

<p>
    Zend Framework takes security seriously. If we verify a reported security 
    vulnerability, our policy is:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>We will patch the current release branch, as well as the immediate prior 
    minor release branch.</li>

    <li>After patching the release branches, we will immediately issue new 
    security fix releases for each patched release branch.</li>

    <li>A security advisory will be released on the Zend Framework site 
    detailing the vulnerability, as well as recommendations for end-users to 
    protect themselves. Security advisories will be listed at <a href="<?php echo 
    $this->url('security/default', array('action' => 'advisories')) ?>">http://framework.zend.com/security/advisories</a>, as well as 
    via a <a href="<?php echo $this->url('security/default', array('action' => 'feed')) ?>">feed</a> (which is also present in the 
    website head for easy feed discovery)</li>
</ul>
