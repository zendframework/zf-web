    We request that you contact us via the email address above and give the

<h3>Policy</h3>

<p>
    Zend Framework takes security seriously. If we verify a reported security 
    vulnerability, our policy is:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>We will patch the current release branch, as well as the immediate prior 
    minor release branch.</li>

    <li>After patching the release branches, we will immediately issue new 
    security fix releases for each patched release branch.</li>

    <li>A security advisory will be released on the Zend Framework site 
    detailing the vulnerability, as well as recommendations for end-users to 
    protect themselves. Security advisories will be listed at <a href="<?php echo 
    $this->url('security/default', array('action' => 'advisories')) ?>">http://framework.zend.com/security/advisories</a>, as well as 
    via a <a href="<?php echo $this->url('security/default', array('action' => 'feed')) ?>">feed</a> (which is also present in the 
    website head for easy feed discovery)</li>
</ul>
