        Frequently Asked Questions About ZF2

    <dl>
        <dt>A new Zend Framework release? Why?</dt>
        <dd>
            We've examined ZF1 from the view point of its architecture,
            as well as the use cases developers have adopted. In many cases,
            we simply cannot support existing use cases, or the architecture
            needs to change in order to do so. Additionally, since ZF1
            grew very organically, there are many places where similar
            solutions to similar problems are inconsistent, leading to
            difficulty educating developers. In Zend Framework 2 we’ve used a
            consistent set of coding patterns and practices and we’ve taken
            into account the generally acknowledged best practices for writing
            efficient, reliable, and high-performing software. </dd>

        <dt>What new features will I find in Zend Framework 2?</dt>
        <dd>Some highlights:
            <ul>
                <li>An entirely re-written event-driven MVC layer</li>
                <li>
                    Components practice dependency injection, supported by
                    our Service Locator and DiC components
                </li>
                <li>A powerful module management system</li>
                <li>
                    An EventManager, for writing event-driven systems, as
                    well as for creating cut points in your software for
                    introducing cross-cutting concerns.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A new view layer, architected around analyzing the
                    request and generating a suitable response, be it
                    plain old HTML, or Atom feeds or JSON.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>Now that Zend Framework 2.0 is released, is Zend Framework 1 is about to be end-of-lifed?</dt>
        <dd>Definitely not! We currently plan to fully support Zend Framework 1 until at least early 2014, including maintenance and security updates.</dd>

        <dt>I have an application built with Zend Framework 1 – will I be able to migrate it to the new version?</dt>
        <dd>Absolutely. An important part of Zend Framework 2 is the migration layer that will allow ZF 1 code to run on the new ZF 2 engine, which will be made available in the future. With it, you will be able to add new ZF 2 code, and refactor existing code, at a controlled pace. </dd>

        <dt>I’m starting a new project – which version of Zend Framework should I use?</dt>
        <dd>Start using Zend Framework 2! It's already stable.</dd>

        <dt>What version of PHP is Zend Framework 2 based on?</dt>
        <dd>Zend Framework 2 is based on PHP 5.3. We expect to add support for PHP 5.4 once it starts to be adopted by the PHP community.</dd>

        <dt>I’m convinced, where can I try out the latest release?</dt>
        <dd>You can download the latest build from <a href="http://packages.zendframework.com">http://packages.zendframework.com</a>. You can also get more information about the Zend Framework 2 project at <a href="http://framework.zend.com/zf2/">http://framework.zend.com/zf2/</a>. </dd>
