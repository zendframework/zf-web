<p>
    Zend Framework version 1 will be supported through __ of ____.  At which point
    it will be EOL.  Version 1.12 is the last version in the 1.x series with new features.
    If it is a new feature you wish to contribute, the best place to take this is ZF2.
</p>

<p>
    For ZF1, we are accepting bug fixes to existing components.  Security fixes will
    be provided on both the 1.11 and 1.12 branch until EOL.  If you have a fix for
    a ZF1 issue, please carefully read
    <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Contributing+to+Zend+Framework">this document.</a>
    It explains the procedures as it relates to the ZF1 process: using subversion, gaining access
    to the repository, and signing/sending in the Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

<p class="panel">
    Note: while ZF2 is CLA free, ZF1 and its contribution process still require this.
    The license has not changed, and like ZF2 is the New BSD license.
