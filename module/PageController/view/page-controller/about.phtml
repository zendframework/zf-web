<p>
    Zend Framework 2 is an open source framework for developing web applications and services
    using <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP 5.3+</a>. Zend Framework 2 uses 100% object-oriented
    code and utilises most of the new features of PHP 5.3, namely namespaces, late static binding,
    lambda functions and closures.
</p>

<p>
    Zend Framework 2 evolved from Zend Framework 1, a successful PHP framework with over
    15 million downloads.
</p>

<p>
    The component structure of Zend Framework 2 is unique; each component is designed with few
    dependencies on other components. ZF2 follows the SOLID object oriented design principle.
    This loosely coupled architecture allows developers to use whichever components they want.
    We call this a “use-at-will” design. We support <a href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/pyrus.php">Pyrus</a>
    and <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> as installation and dependency tracking
    mechanisms for the framework as a whole and for each component, further enhancing this design.
</p>

<p>
    We use <a href="http://www.phpunit.de">PHPUnit</a> to test our code and <a href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/zendframework/zf2">Travis CI</a> as a Continuous Integration service.
</p>

<p>
    While they can be used separately, Zend Framework 2 components in the standard library form a
    powerful and extensible web application framework when combined. Also, it offers a robust, high
    performance MVC implementation, a database abstraction that is simple to use, and a forms component
    that implements HTML5 form rendering, validation, and filtering so that developers can consolidate all
    of these operations using one easy-to-use, object oriented interface. Other components, such as
    Zend\Authentication and Zend\Permissions\Acl, provide user authentication and authorization against all
    common credential stores.
</p>

<p>
    Still others, with the ZendService namespace, implement client libraries to simply access the most
    popular web services available. Whatever your application needs are, you’re likely to find a Zend
    Framework 2 component that can be used to dramatically reduce development time with a thoroughly
    tested foundation.
</p>

<p>
    The principal sponsor of the project ‘Zend Framework 2’ is <a href="http://www.zend.com">Zend Technologies</a>,
    but many companies have contributed components or significant features to the framework. 
    Companies such as <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>,
    and <a href="http://www.strikeiron.com">StrikeIron</a> have partnered with Zend to provide interfaces to web 
    services and other technologies they wish to make available to Zend Framework 2 developers.
</p>

<p>
    Zend Framework 2 could not deliver and support all of these features without the help of the vibrant 
    Zend Framework 2 community. Community members, including contributors, make themselves available on
    <a href="/archives">mailing lists</a>, <a href="/irc">IRC</a> channels and other forums.
    Whatever question you have about Zend Framework 2, the community is always available to address it.
