    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>In the documentation, the content used for index.php uses an alternative short syntax for the if control statement mixed with the alternative OR/|| syntax following a statement that equates to FALSE. Not all readers will be familiar with this syntax and it's quite confusing compared to the usual if () {} elseif () {} else {} form which is far more legible and assists understanding what's going on when setting up the APPLICATION constants.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>First, it would have been nice to know where exactly in the documentation you were referring to -- I had to hunt a little. :) (Code in question is in documentation/manual/en/module_specs/Zend_Application-QuickStart.xml)</p>

<p>Second, this is not a coding standards violation; the code conforms to the ZF CS just fine. Your comments are more regarding readability of the provided code.</p>

<p>I understand your concerns, but there are two things to weigh here: readability, and conciseness.</p>

<p>For those reading this not familiar with the lines of code in question, they
are:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
// Define path to application directory
defined('APPLICATION_PATH')
    || define('APPLICATION_PATH',
              realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../application'));

// Define application environment
defined('APPLICATION_ENV')
    || define('APPLICATION_ENV',
              (getenv('APPLICATION_ENV') ? getenv('APPLICATION_ENV')
                                         : 'production'));
</code></pre>

<p>To make it more readable, I might write:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
if (!defined('APPLICATION_PATH')) {
    // Define path to application directory
    define('APPLICATION_PATH',
           realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../application'));
}

if (!defined('APPLICATION_ENV')) {
    // Define application environment
    if (getenv('APPLICATION_ENV')) {
        define('APPLICATION_ENV', getenv('APPLICATION_ENV'));
    } else {
        define('APPLICATION_ENV', 'production');
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The two are equivalent. My personal preference is for the former, because it's more concise, and the provided whitespace offsets it more cleanly visually from the code it precedes. The "||" usage is not often seen in PHP, but is a standard idiom in other languages, and a very fast way to decision. Finally, I prefer the fact that define() is only called in a single line rather than multiple lines in the case of the APPLICATION_ENV variable.</p>

<p>The second has the benefit of using very recognizable control structures, making the flow easier to read -- but looks slightly more bulky and less fluent.</p>

<p>I'm okay with modifying the code to use the second syntax, but, honestly, I've not heard any complaints about it other than this one.</p>

<p>Developers familiar with JavaScript should not have a hard time with this syntax. As Matthew stated, this syntax is not only more concise but is also used quite a lot (we have many Polyglot programmers in our PHP developer community after all).</p>

<p>I believe it would be fair to close this issue.</p>
