    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The spec requires a Consumer to fallback to SHA1 authentication if it receives a message saying that the Provider doesn't support SHA256, which it's not required to do.</p>

            <p>This patch solves the problem.  It alters _httpRequest to properly parse OpenId messages and return the values they give back to whatever is calling it.</p>

<p>Additionally, it falls back to sha1 encryption if sha256 fails, generating a new keypair in the process, just for safety's sake.  It should also alter all the other places that call _httpRequest.</p>

<p>I've sort of hacked it together from our implementation, so I'm not quite sure if it's working, because I had to remove some key parts from our implementation before handing it over, but it kinda gives the idea of what the fix needs to happen in case.</p>

            <p>Do you know a way to test the patch? (May be some OpenId provider which is affected by this bug)</p>

            <p>Yeah, in 1.5.1 the Consumer fails on any 2.0 provider which doesn't support SHA-256.  This includes Yahoo, and I think every other 2.0 provider that we tried, though I can't recall any of the other ones at the moment.  Yahoo is the one I tested against, though, during which I discovered this bug and the url fragment bug.</p>

            <p>Oh yeah, I remembered now.  Beemba is another one, but I wouldn't test against them because they weren't fully up to spec, and my patch had to be loosened against spec to get them to work.</p>

<p><a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html#rfc.section.8.2.4">http://openid.net/specs/…</a></p>

<p>That's the relevant portion of the spec.  Beemba was returning unsupported-type but wasn't setting HTTP_STATUS to 400, which the spec requires.</p>

<p>Because these are really openid messages that are being passed back, I figured that I'd move their parsing outside of the _httpRequest function, since it seems like _associate() or verify() should be the ones interacting with the openid level of the protocol...</p>
