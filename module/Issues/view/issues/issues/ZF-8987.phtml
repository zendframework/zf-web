    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>It would be nice if Zend_View_Helper_Abstract contained a few more helper methods. The main one I seem to reuse and have setup in my own abstract class (which is then difficult to use when extending placeholders etc.) is the _getAttribs method.</p>

<p>This has been taken from a helper in the framework and appears to be re-used a fair amount. Some other helpers call it with a different name.</p>

<p>As view helpers are concerned primarily with returning some form of html it would (to me anyway) make sense to include it in the abstract class.</p>

<pre class="literal">
/**
     * Return the attributes formatted as xhtml in key value pairs
     *
     * @param array $attribs Array of attributes in key value pairs
     */
    protected function _getAttribs($attribs)
    {
        $return = '';
        if (!empty($attribs)) {
            foreach ($attribs AS $key =&gt; $item) {
                if (!empty($item)) {
                    $return .= ' '. $key . '="' . $item .'"';
                }
            }
        }
        return $return;
    }
</pre>

            <p>View helpers are not entirely about returning HTML; in fact, the View object is not entirely about returning HTML. Helpers are intended simply for extending the functionality of the View object, plain and simple. As such, the base, abstract view helper simply provides the most basic of functionality necessary, which we have, at this point, deemed the ability to inject the view object.</p>

<p>We have another abstract view helper that can be used for HTML-specific output, Zend_View_Helper_HtmlElement. This provides an _htmlAttribs() method (similar to the one you suggest here), as well as a number of other useful methods (_isXhtml(),getClosingBracket(), _normalizeId()). I would suggest extending this class when you need such functionality, rather than having us introduce these methods into Zend_View_Helper_Abstract.</p>
