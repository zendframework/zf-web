            <p>Your example above looks like there are empty lines between each encoded line - is this how it is on your email source or is that just the way JIRA is displaying it? If there's extra linespaces it may be throwing the mail clients you mentioned.</p>

            <p>Hello,
Thanks for responding. In the above example, the first block is the email as it appears on Gmail. The last block with the full headers is the actual email source.
Note that the broken words match the end of lines (=) in the source. Such as the words "e nregistré", "pré sentement", "votre co mpte", "Merc i", and of course the link.</p>

<p>It clearly has something to do with the maximum line length, but I'm not sure what I can do about it. Surely there is a way to use Zend_Mail without words being split like that (especially if it breaks important links), but I haven't been able to figure out how, so I reported it here.</p>

            <p>I will just confirm that this happens for me as well.
One thing that I will note is that this did not appear for me in any versions 0.7 and before.
It started occurring when I moved to version 0.8 and continues to do it in version 0.9</p>

            <p>I have found a few resources that may help in the solving of this bug. The website:
<a href="http://www.nabble.com/Zend_Mail-problem-with-special-chars-and-automatic-line-break-t3128214s16154.html">http://nabble.com/Zend_Mail-problem-with-special-c…</a>
has an interesting note about something that sounds the same.</p>

<p>The problem was:</p>

<pre class="literal"> 
&gt; Second, a long line with a link gets an automatic line break in the
&gt; middle of the link which makes the link invalid. Also I would like to
&gt; add a couple of empty lines but Zend_Mail always gets rid of them. I
&gt; would rather prefer to handle the line breaks myself to prevent
&gt; Zend_Mail from splitting up words and links in the middle. 
</pre>

<p>And the bug was stated as:</p>

<pre class="literal"> 
- Finally, the bug: When using the Zend_Mail default transport --  
PHP's own mail() function (sendmail) -- all of the CRLF end-of-line  
sequences that Zend_Mime::encodeQuotedPrintable() correctly generates  
are silently duplicated in the resulting message body. This results  
in the correct 'soft line break' to continue a line, followed by an  
additional CRLF by itself which mail clients interpret as a genuine  
line break. 
</pre>

<p>And the temporary fix that I am thinking about using in the mean time is:</p>

<pre class="literal"> 
2. If you're only ever going to use the default sendmail transport  
with Zend_Mail, you can change Zend_Mime::encodeQuotedPrintable() so  
that it only generates a single LF end-of-line sequence which will  
not be duplicated by PHP's mail() function (this is the solution  
proposed by Kevin in ZF-264). Change line 74 of Zend_Mime from this:

   const LINEEND = "\r\n";

to this:

   const LINEEND = "\n";

This change will cause problems if you attempt to use the SMTP  
transport because now the end-of-line sequence is wrong. Your  
messages will likely be rejected at some point in the delivery chain.

            <p>Why thankyou thing! (Couldn't resist)</p>

<p>Thanks for following up the bugs. Problem is, Zend_Db_Transport_Sendmail <em>does</em> use the default PHP lineending instead of "\r\n". So UNIX defaults to "\n".</p>

<p>It's not an easy one to track insofar as we're seeing different results using the same MTA so I'd like to find some more common threads before we start committing changes.</p>

<p>This bug is still a priority but a fix will only be on the way once we're 100% sure!</p>

            <p>I have the same problem using the Postfix MTA 2.2.10 on RHEL 4. My work-around for now is <em>not</em> to use the quoted-printable encoding. This is easily done by extending the Zend_Mail class and has the advantage that you don't need to edit the ZF files (e.g. Zend_Mime LINEEND work-around above). All you need to do is change the</p>

<p>{{$mp-&gt;encoding = Zend_Mime::ENCODING_QUOTEDPRINTABLE;}}</p>

            <p>As Simon has written this bug is not easy to track down. Newlines are handled differently depending on the platform and MTA. As Tony has written one workaround is a different encoding. With the fix to ZF-980 the encoding can be changed with the third parameter in setBodyText() and setBodyHtml().</p>
