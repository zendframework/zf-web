    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I am sure I have seen this mentioned but can't find it now. In the modules resource the default module can't have a it's own bootstrap.</p>

<p>I would of thought this should be changed to allow any module to be used as a default, which may in turn have it's own bootstrap file.</p>

<p>Is the idea that the application bootstrap should extend your default modules bootstrap?</p>

            <p>What more worst: because "default" is skipped no Resource Autoloader is created.
For consistance this skipping of "default" should be undone.</p>

            <p>I don't know how to submit a proper patch, but maybe someone who does will find this useful. This 'patch' should resolve the issue.</p>

            <p>I also think it would be usefull to have a default module bootstrap</p>

<p>its not really usefull, cause you can also put the init functions in the application bootstrap, but i think its easier to understand, if i have to explain bootstrapping to somebody who doesnt know zf, i simply tell him each module has its own bootstrap and the application itself has a (main)-bootstrap</p>

<p>i dont know why it was done like it is, there is probably a good reason, but if you dont want to change the behavior to allow a default bootstap, then at least add the possibility to add a parameter in the config file which lets you choose i want a default bootsrap or i dont want, if you want one the default module bootsrap should be loaded</p>

            <p>This patch should be incorporated into the latest ZF release. No resource autoloader is created which is a pain.</p>

            <p>This patch is naive.</p>

<p>The reason that the default module is skipped is because the documented use case -- particularly how we setup an application in Zend_Tool -- is that the default module is directly beneath application/ and contains the application bootstrap. If we then allow loading the default module's bootstrap... we get into a recursive loop. This is precisely what will happen if we apply the attached patch -- I know, because that logic is there because the recursive loop occurred while I was developing the functionality originally, and the code removed by the patch recreates the original code.</p>

<p>However, I <em>think</em> I may be able to come up with a working patch by checking any given bootstrap against the one registered with the resource, and will be attempting it shortly.</p>

            <p>Your probably right, i'm a naive (script kiddy) ;) but i'm happy to help a little bit, by opening new bug reprts or replying to existing ones, even if my "naivity" doesnt made it impossible for me to provide a good fix ;)</p>

<p>I applied the fix to my test application and it worked very well!</p>

<p>My websites have this structure:</p>

<ul><li>application
--bootstrap.php //application bootstrap, setups cache, db profiler ...
--config
---application.xml
--layouts
--caches
--logs
--modules
---moduleA
----bootsrap.php // module bootsrap, setups translations, routes, loads module config file ...
---configs
----translations.tmx
----config.xml
----routes.xml
---moduleB
----bootsrap.php
---moduleC
----bootsrap.php</li>
</ul><p>Now if i switch the default module, from A to B, the only change i have to do is to change the row resources.frontcontroller.defaultmodule in the application.xml</p>

<p>As i said before, if i have to explain how my app works to somebody new that all module has its own bootsrap and dont need to tell him that the default module does not</p>

<p>Thx a lot for solving the problem you made me (and probably others) really happy ;)</p>

            <p>I'm sorry if I may have caused offense with the word "naive". The intent behind my usage was based on the definition "uninstructed: lacking information or instruction" -- basically, it was a patch that did not take into account all the existing use cases. However, this report, and others I've heard, made this a pretty big priority to accommodate, and I'm glad the solution works for you!</p>

            <p>No problem. I wasnt offended, but it was some sort of displeasure. I know lots of devs that dont want to ask stuff in forums or mailinglists because they are afraid somebody could call them dumb. Thats why i prefer if people are carefull about the words they use. I know you didnt want to harm anybody and i know you always answer to questions even if they come from naive devs ;)</p>

<p>One year ago i started working with ZF, since then i used it for three websites, unfortunatly i did have a lot of time to really learn how it works i simply used it, last month i tried to start a proposal for a zend_google_wave component but really fast i noticed that my knowledge was not good enough, i was also afraid people could laugh at me because my proposal is not as good as theirs. As soon as i'm able to improve my knowledge i will perhaps finish it and then publish it, i just hope people wont laugh ;)</p>

<p>Enough of topic, sorry for consuming your precious time, i'm a huge ZF, Zend and of course Matthew Weier O'Phinney fan ;)</p>

            <p>Hi. I am doing a similar thing and hoped you could post the project skeleton (maybe a zip or inline code) that you have described above (or at least the config.ini (or .xml), application bootstrap and each module bootstrap. This issue is now a few months old, but the ZF documentation has not made it much easier. Thanks.</p>
