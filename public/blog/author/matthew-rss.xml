      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
    of Zend Framework 2.2.0rc1! Packages and installation instructions are
    available at:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://packages.zendframework.com/">http://packages.zendframework.com/</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    This is a <em>release candidate</em>. It is not the final release, and 
    while stability is generally considered good, there may still be issues
    to resolve between now and the stable release. Use in production with 
    caution.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>DO</strong> please test your applications on this RC, as we would 
    like to ensure that it remains backwards compatible, and that the migration
    path is smooth.
</p><h2>Changes in this version</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
    <p>
        <strong>Addition of many more plugin managers and abstract service factories.</strong>
        In order to simplify usage of the <code>ServiceManager</code> as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control">Inversion of Control</a> 
        container, as well as to provide more flexibility in and consistency in how various
        framework components are consumed, a number of plugin managers and service factories
        were created and enabled. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Among the various plugin managers created are Translator loader manager, a Hydrator
        plugin manager (allowing named hydrator instances), and an InputFilter manager.
    </p>

    <p>
        New factories include a Translator service factory, and factories for 
        both the Session configuration and SessionManager.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        New abstract factories include one for the DB component (allowing you to manage
        multiple named adapters), Loggers (for having multiple Logger instances),
        Cache storage (for managing multiple cache backends), and Forms (which makes use
        of the existing FormElementsPluginManager, as well as the new Hydrator and InputFilter
        plugin managers).
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p>
        <strong>Data Definition Language (DDL) support in Zend\Db.</strong> DDL 
        provides the ability to create, alter, and drop tables in a relational 
        database system. Zend\Db now offers abstraction around DDL, and 
        specifically MySQL and ANSI SQL-92; we will gradually add this 
        capability for the other database vendors we support.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Authentication:</strong> The DB adapter now supports non-RDBMS credential validation.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Cache:</strong> New storage backend: Redis.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Code:</strong> The ClassGenerator now has a removeMethod() method.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Console:</strong> Incremental improvements to layout and colorization of banners
        and usage messages; fixes for how literal and non-literal matches are returned.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>DB:</strong> New DDL support (noted earlier); many incremental improvements.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Filter:</strong> New DateTimeFormatter filter.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Form:</strong> Many incremental improvements to selected 
        elements; new FormAbstractServiceFactory for defining form services; minor improvements
        to make the form component work with the DI service factory.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>InputFilter</strong>: new CollectionInputFilter for working 
        with form Collections; new InputFilterPluginManager providing 
        integration and services for the ServiceManager.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>I18n:</strong> We removed ext/intl as a hard requirement, and made it only a
        suggested requirement; the Translator has an optional dependency on the EventManager,
        providing the ability to tie into "missing message" and "missing translations" events;
        new country-specific PhoneNumber validator.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>ModuleManager:</strong> Now allows passing actual Module instances (not just names).
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Navigation:</strong> Incremental improvements, particularly to URL generation.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>MVC:</strong> You can now configure the initial set of MVC 
        event listeners in the configuration file; the MVC stack now detects generic HTTP responses
        when detecting event short circuiting; the default ExceptionStrategy 
        now allows returning JSON; opt-in translatable segment routing; many incremental
        improvements to the AbstractRestfulController to make it more configurable and
        extensible; the Forward plugin was refactored to no longer require a 
        ServiceLocatorAware controller, and instead receive the ControllerManager via its
        factory.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Paginator:</strong> Support for TableGateway objects.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>ServiceManager:</strong> Incremental improvements; performance optimizations;
        delegate factories, which provide a way to write factories for objects that replace
        a service with a decorator; "lazy" factories, allowing the ability to 
        delay factory creation invocation until the moment of first use.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Stdlib:</strong> Addition of a HydratorAwareInterface; creation 
        of a HydratorPluginManager.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>SOAP:</strong> Major refactor of WSDL generation to make it more maintainable.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Validator:</strong> New Brazilian IBAN format for IBAN validator; validators 
        now only return unique error messages; improved Maestro detection in 
        CreditCard validator.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Version:</strong> use the ZF website API for finding the latest version,
        instead of GitHub.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>View:</strong> Many incremental improvements, primarily to 
        helpers; deprecation of the Placeholder Registry and removal of it from 
        the implemented placeholder system; new explicit factory classes for helpers
        that have collaborators (making them easier to override/replace).
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Changelog</h2>

<p>
    Almost 200 patches were applied for 2.2.0. We will not release a full
    changelog until we create the stable release. In the meantime, you can
    view a full set of patches applied for 2.2.0 in the 2.2.0 milestone on
    GitHub:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/issues?milestone=14&state=closed">Zend Framework 2.2.0 milestone</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Announcements</h2>

<p>
    Around a month ago, we migrated <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf1">Zend 
    Framework 1 to GitHub</a>. At that time, we also migrated active issues created since
    1.12.0 to the <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf1/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>,
    and marked our self-hosted issue tracker read-only. We have decided to turn off that issue
    tracker, but still retain the original issues at their original locations for purposes
    of history and transparency. You can find information on the change on our <a href="/issues">
    issues landing page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Thank You!</h2>

<p>
    Please join me in thanking everyone who provided new features and code 
    improvements for this upcoming 2.2.0 release!
</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>
    We plan to release additional RCs every 3-5 days until we feel the 2.2.0
    release is generally stable; we anticipate a stable release in the next
    2-3 weeks.
</p>

<p>
    During the RC period, we will be expanding on documentation, and fixing any
    critical issues brought to our attention.
</p>

<p>
    Again, <strong>DO</strong> please test your applications on this RC, as we 
    would like to ensure that it remains backwards compatible, and that the 
    migration path is smooth.

      <title>Zend Framework 2.1.5 Released!</title>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2013 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>http://framework.zend.com/blog/zend-framework-2-1-5-released.html</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
    of Zend Framework 2.1.5! Packages and installation instructions are
    available at:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/downloads/latest">http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    This is a monthly maintenance release.
</p><h2>Notable changes</h2>

<p>
    2.1.5 is a monthly maintenance release, and the bulk of issues resolved
    were primarily centered around code maintainability - docblocks typos were
    corrected, internal variables renamed more semantically, etc. However, a
    few changes are notable:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A long-standing issue <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/4226">regarding 
        setting global permissions in <code>Zend\Permissions\Acl</code></a> was resolved.
    </li>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/4241"><code>Zend\Db\Metadata</code> 
        was updated to no longer use the untrusted <code>quoteValue()</code> 
        API</a>; this means it will no longer create notices!
    </li>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/4148">Filter 
        priority settings are no longer lost when merging filter chains.</a>
    </li>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/4147">The stop-propagation flag is
        now reset when triggering an event.</a> This solves a problem that occurred in the MVC
        when triggering multiple different events in succession.
    </li>

    <li>A fix was applied to prevent <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/4168"><code>Zend\Console</code>
        from bleeding color to the next line</a>.
    </li>

    <li><code>Zend\Navigation</code> now <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/4084">supports 
        query parameters properly</a>.
    </li>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/issues/3373">Forms now allow empty
        collections</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/issues/2898"><code>Zend\Navigation</code>
        now properly injects pages with dependencies</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Manual improvements</h2>

<p>
    Last month, we held our first <a href="http://framework.zend.com/blog//2013-03-28-help-us-improve-the-documentation.html">documentation hunt</a>, 
    resulting in a lot of documentation improvements.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, we began an effort to provide Zend Framework 1 -&gt; Zend 
    Framework 2 migration information. <a href="http://zf2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/migration/overview.html">A 
    preview is available on readthedocs.org</a>.
</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>

<p>
    Almost 100 patches were applied to the ZF2 codebase, and dozens to the documentation.
    The full changelog for 2.1.5 is available:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/changelog/2.1.5">http://framework.zend.com/changelog/2.1.5</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Thank You!</h2>

<p>
    I'd like to thank everyone who provided issue reports, typo fixes, maintenance
    improvements, bugfixes, and documentation improvements; your efforts make the
    framework increasingly better!
</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>
    Maintenance releases happen monthly on the third Wednesday. Version 2.2.0 
    will release in the first half of May, with the first release candidate dropping
    during the week of 29 April - 3 May 2013.

      <title>Zend Framework 1 is Migrating to Git!</title>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2013 16:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>http://framework.zend.com/blog/2013-03-27-zf1-git-migration.html</link>
      <guid>http://framework.zend.com/blog/2013-03-27-zf1-git-migration.html</guid>
      <author>matthew@zend.com (Matthew Weier O'Phinney)</author>
      <dc:creator>Matthew Weier O'Phinney</dc:creator>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    Since its inception, Zend Framework 1 has used <a 
    href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>
    for versioning. However, as we approach its end-of-life (which will occur 
    12-18 months from the time this post is written), and as our experience
    with ZF2 processes becomes more familiar, we -- the Zend team and the Community
    Review team -- feel that we can better support ZF1 via <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
    As such, we will be migrating the ZF1 Subversion repository to GitHub this 
    week. Please read on for details!
</p><h2>What will happen</h2>

<h3>Subversion Access</h3>

<p>
    <strong>First: you will still have access to Subversion!</strong> 
</p>

<p>
    For versions prior to 1.12, we will continue hosting our current Subversion 
    repository, and if you are using <code>svn:externals</code> with a tag or
    branch on that repository, that will continue to work. However, the
    repository will be read-only going forward.
</p>

<p>
    The release-1.12 branch, however, will become the "master" branch on the GitHub
    repository. All future updates, including security fixes, will be made to this
    branch and this branch only; future tags will be made against GitHub. 
    However, for those of you using Subversion, all is not lost: 
    Github <a href="https://github.com/blog/966-improved-subversion-client-support">supports</a> 
    <a href="https://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support">Subversion</a>!
    (That's <em>2</em> separate links!)
</p>

<p>
    If you are pointing your <code>svn:externals</code> at either trunk or the 
    release-1.12 branch, you will need to update your <code>svn:externals</code>
    to point at the new repository location. To do this, you will execute the 
    following:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
[user@server]$ svn propedit svn:externals path/in/working-dir/to/zf1
</pre>

<p>
    This will spawn an editor. In that editor, change the URL for ZF1:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        "http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk" becomes 
        <strong>"https://github.com/zendframework/zf1/trunk"</strong>
    </li>

    <li>
        "http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/branches/release-1.12" becomes 
        <strong>"https://github.com/zendframework/zf1/trunk"</strong>
    </li>

    <li>
        "http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/tags/release-1.12<code>.*</code>" become
        <strong>"https://github.com/zendframework/zf1/tags/release-1.12<code>.*</code>"</strong>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Once you have made this change, save and exit. Then run:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
[user@server]$ svn commit -m "update externals"
</pre>

<h3>svn:externals - Dojo</h3>

<p>
    Currently, the ZF1 repository defines a single <code>svn:externals</code> 
    property, which adds <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo Toolkit</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Currently, this points to version 1.5 of Dojo, as that is the last version 
    with which ZF1 maintained compatibility. We have decided with the move to
    GitHub to remove the <code>svn:externals</code> entry, and <em>not</em> add
    a git submodule; however, we <em>will</em> continue packaging Dojo 1.5 in
    any ZF1 releases.
</p>

<p>
    If you relied on the <code>svn:externals</code> definition in ZF1 in order
    to obtain Dojo, you will need to add it to your repository yourself. If you
    need to do so, point the definition at "http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/branches/1.5".
</p>

<h3>"Extras" Repository</h3>

<p>
    The "extras" repository, which contains the jQuery integration, Firebird DB 
    adapter, and console process forking tools, will also be migrated to GitHub,
    following the same pattern as for the ZF1 repo (i.e., release-1.12 branch
    will become the master branch on the GitHub repository, and the old 
    subversion repository will be marked read-only). You will need to update
    any <code>svn:externals</code> definitions just as you would for ZF1, with
    the following mappings:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        "http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/extras/trunk" becomes 
        <strong>"https://github.com/zendframework/zf1-extras/trunk"</strong>
    </li>

    <li>
        "http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/extras/branches/release-1.12" becomes 
        <strong>"https://github.com/zendframework/zf1-extras/trunk"</strong>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Issue Tracker</h3>

<p>
    Since Zend Framework 1 is in maintenance mode at this time, we are only 
    addressing critical or security issues. As such, we have decided to port 
    only open issues created since 1.12.0 was released (at the time of this 
    writing, around 66 issues) to GitHub issues.
</p>

<p>
    The JIRA instance will be marked read-only. We will likely disable it in
    the near future; if we do so, we will likely provide static pages of all
    issues for later reference. <em>(This item is still to be determined.)</em>
</p>

<p>
    Information on the new issue tracker location will be placed on the JIRA
    landing page, with links to each of the ZF1, ZF1 Extras, and ZF2 
    repositories.
</p>

<h3>Collaboration</h3>

<p>
    Once the cutover occurs, only the Zend team and the Community Review team will
    have commit rights on the GitHub repository. This means that patches will need
    to be submitted as <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">Pull
    Requests</a>. Once submitted, members of these teams, as well as the 
    general community, can comment and provide feedback; once consensus is reached
    that the patch is ready, it will be merged to the repository.
</p>

<p>
    If you are unfamiliar with Git and/or GitHub, we recommend the following resources:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://help.github.com/">GitHub help site</a>, which details
    everything from setting up Git to creating and forking repositories, to collaborating.</li>

    <li><a href="http://git-scm.org">git-scm site</a>, which provides a comprehensive,
    online book detailing basics to advanced features of Git.</li>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/README-GIT.md">ZF2 Git Guide</a>,
    which details the typical contributor workflow; simply substitute "zf1" for "zf2" in that
    guide. (We will likely add this to ZF1 soon as well.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    One note: at this point, we will only accept bug and security fixes; new 
    features are not currently in scope for Zend Framework 1.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Important!</strong> You will still need to have a Contributors License Agreement (CLA)
    on file for us to accept your contributions. For this reason, we recommend setting your
    <code>user.email</code> git configuration setting to the same email used 
    for your CLA; with this information, we can easily look up your CLA status, which will
    expedite our ability to merge your pull requests/patches. To do this, simply execute the
    following from within your ZF1 checkout:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
[user@server]$ git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
</pre>

<p>
    Do this <em>prior</em> to making any commits, to ensure that the commits in 
    your patch are attributed to that email.
</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>
    The plan at this time is to mark the ZF1 subversion repository and issue 
    tracker read-only starting Friday, 5 April 2013.
</p>

<h2>Future</h2>

<p>
    The repository and issues migration is the first step in a series of planned 
    migrations. We also plan to eventually migrate our wiki to GitHub; this will
    allow us to offload functionality from the main ZF website, and also 
    consolidate all development-related functionality (other than the mailing 
    list) in a central location.
</p>

<p>
    If you have any concerns, please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:matthew@zend.com">myself</a>,
    <a href="/contact">my team</a>, or the <a href="mailto:zf-crteam@zend.com">Community Review Team</a>.

      <title>Zend Framework 2.1.4, 2.0.8, and 1.12.3 Released!</title>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2013 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>http://framework.zend.com/blog/2013-03-14-zend-framework-3-for-1-release-day.html</link>
      <guid>http://framework.zend.com/blog/2013-03-14-zend-framework-3-for-1-release-day.html</guid>
      <author>matthew@zend.com (Matthew Weier O'Phinney)</author>
      <dc:creator>Matthew Weier O'Phinney</dc:creator>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
    of three new releases: 2.1.4, 2.0.8, and 1.12.3!  Packages and installation 
    instructions are available at:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/downloads/latest">http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The ZF2 releases include three security updates, and all ZF versions also 
    include updates to the Twitter component to follow the Twitter v1.1 API, 
    which is not backwards compatible with previous versions.
</p><h2>Security Fixes</h2>

<p>
    2.1.4 and 2.0.8 contain three security fixes.
</p>

<h3>Query Route</h3>

<p>
    We were alerted to the fact that the Query route could override parameters
    matched in parent routes, effectively bypassing constraints defined. In
    particular, this could result in overriding the controller or action matched
    by a given route.
</p>

<p>
    The query route was deprecated, as a replacement exists within the HTTP router
    itself. You can pass a "query" option to the assemble method containing either
    the query string or an array of key-value pairs:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
$url = $router->assemble(array(
    'name' => 'foo',
), array(
    'query' => array(
        'page' => 3,
        'sort' => 'DESC',
    ), 
    // or: 'query' => 'page=3&sort=DESC'
));

// via URL helper/plugin:
$rendererOrController->url('foo', array(), array('query' => $request->getQuery()));
</pre>

<p>
    Additionally, the merging of query parameters into the route match was removed
    entirely. Please use the query container of the request object instead.

<h3>Random Number Generation</h3>

<p>
    The <code>Zend\Math\Rand</code> component generates random bytes using the OpenSSL
    or Mcrypt extensions when available but will otherwise use PHP's
    <code>mt_rand()</code> function as a fallback. All outputs from <code>mt_rand()</code> are
    predictable for the same PHP process if an attacker can brute force
    the seed - which can be done if the attacker has access to a random number
    generated by `mt_rand` or the session ID (if generated without using additional
    entropy). 
</p>

<p>
    Zend Framework have revised the <code>Zend\Math\Rand</code> component to replace the
    current <code>mt_rand()</code> fallback for OpenSSL/Mcrypt with Anthony Ferrara's
    <a href="https://github.com/ircmaxell/RandomLib">RandomLib</a>, incorporating an additional
    entropy source based on <a href="https://github.com/GeorgeArgyros/Secure-random-bytes-in-PHP">source code published by George Argyros</a>. The new
    fallback collects entropy from numerous sources other than PHP's internal seed
    mechanism and extracts random bytes from the resulting mixed entropy pool.
</p>

    <a href="/security/advisory/ZF2013-02">ZF2013-02</a>.
</p>

<h3>Database Platform Quoting</h3>

<p>
    Altered <code>Zend\Db</code> to throw notices when insecure usage of the 
    following methods is called: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>Zend\Db\Adapter\Platform\*::quoteValue*()</code></li>
    <li><code>Zend\Db\Sql\*::getSqlString*()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Fixed <code>Zend\Db</code> Platform objects to use driver level quoting when provided, and
    throw <code>E_USER_NOTICE</code> when not provided.  Added <code>quoteTrustedValue()</code> API for
    notice-free value quoting.  Fixed all userland quoting in Platform objects to
    handle a wider array of escapable characters.

<h2>Twitter API Updates</h2>

<p>
    Twitter has begun sunsetting its v1.0 API, and has introduced rolling 
    blackouts in order to prompt developers to move to the v1.1 API. 
    Unfortunately, v1.1 is not backwards compatible with v1.0, so a number
    of backwards-breaking changes need to be made.
</p>

<p>
    Version 2.1.0 of <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_Twitter">ZendService_Twitter</a>
    and version 1.12.3 of Zend Framework have been released with support for 
    v1.1 of the Twitter API. A number of service endpoints were removed, and others
    moved to new namespaces. As such, if you use the component, you are urged to upgrade,
    and we encourage you to read the documentation to see what methods are now available,
    and how to use OAuth access tokens with the service.
</p>

<h2>Polyfill Support Fixes</h2>

<p>
    Polyfills (version-specific class replacements) have caused some issues in 
    the 2.1 series for users of <code>Zend\Stdlib</code> and 
    <code>Zend\Session</code>.  In particular, users who were not using Composer 
    were unaware/uncertain about what extra files needed to be included to load 
    polyfills, and those users who were generating classmaps were running into 
    issues since the same class was being generated twice.
</p>

<p>
    New polyfill support was created which does the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>New, uniquely named classes were created for each polyfill base.</li>

    <li>A stub class file was created for each class needing polyfill support. 
    A conditional is present in each that uses <code>class_alias</code> to 
    alias the appropriate polyfill base as an import. The stub class then 
    extends the base.</li>

    <li>The <code>compatibility/autoload.php</code> file in each component affected was altered to trigger an <code>E_USER_DEPRECATED</code> error asking the user to remove the require statement for the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The functionality works with both Composer and ZF2's autoloading support, using
    either PSR-0 or classmaps. All typehinting is preserved.
</p>

      <title>Zend Framework 2.1.3 Released!</title>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2013 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>http://framework.zend.com/blog/zend-framework-2-1-3-released.html</link>
      <guid>http://framework.zend.com/blog/zend-framework-2-1-3-released.html</guid>
      <author>matthew@zend.com (Matthew Weier O'Phinney)</author>
      <dc:creator>Matthew Weier O'Phinney</dc:creator>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
    of Zend Framework 2.1.3! Packages and installation instructions are
    available at:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/downloads/latest">http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    This release has been pushed out quickly on the heels of 2.1.2 to fix an
    issue with autoloading PHP version-specific class implementations that was
    affecting PHP 5.3.3 users. Two other potential regressions were also
    addressed.
</p><h2>PHP 5.3.3 Users</h2>

<p>
    This release finally resolves issues with providing PHP version-specific 
    classes, specifically for PHP 5.3.3 users.
</p>

<p>
    If you are using <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> to manager
    your dependencies, a <code>composer.phar update</code> should resolve any
    issues.
</p>

<p>
    If you are not, you have two options.
</p>

<p>
    First, when starting new applications with the <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication">ZendSkeletonApplication</a>,
    class substitution will now happen by default.
</p>

<p>
    Otherwise, add the following lines to your <code>init_autoloader.php</code>
    file, as indicated by the comments below:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
// The following line should be on or around line 34:
if ($zf2Path) {
    if (isset($loader)) {
        $loader->add('Zend', $zf2Path);
    } else {
        include $zf2Path . '/Zend/Loader/AutoloaderFactory.php';
        Zend\Loader\AutoloaderFactory::factory(array(
            'Zend\Loader\StandardAutoloader' => array(
                'autoregister_zf' => true
            )
        ));

        // Add the following two lines:
        require $zf2Path . '/Zend/Stdlib/compatibility/autoload.php';
        require $zf2Path . '/Zend/Session/compatibility/autoload.php';
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Routing Fixes</h2>

<p>
    Two fixes to routing were made after discovering potential regressions.
</p>

<p>
    The first was to hostname routing. Changes were introduced in 2.1.2 to make 
    matching optional nested subdomains possible; unfortunately, this broke cases
    where the primary domain was specified. A fix has been included in 2.1.3 that
    fixes the regression (while simultaneously allowing the new behavior).
</p>

<p>
    A bug in console routing was also uncovered; camelCased or MixedCase options
    were allowed in route definitions, but route matching was normalizing options
    to lowercase, causing false negative matches. This was fixed for 2.1.3.
</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>

<p>
    Below are links to the issues addressed.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/issues/3714">3714: Zend\Stdlib\ArrayObject::offsetExists() returning by reference</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/issues/3855">3855: Fix #3852</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/issues/3856">3856: Simple route case insensitive</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Thank You!</h2>

<p>
    I'd like to thank those that tested the PHP 5.3.3 autoloading fixes, as well
    as Nick Calugar for providing the fix to hostname routing and Michael Gallego
    for the fixes to console routing.
</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>
    Maintenance releases happen monthly on the third Wednesday; expect version 2.1.4
    to drop 20 March 2013. We're also gearing up for version 2.2.0, which we are 
    targetting at the end of April 2013.

<p>
    We had a number of minor breakages with the 2.1 release, primarily around changes
    to the session and form components and cross-version compatibility. These should
    all be fixed at this point.
</p><h2>Changelog</h2>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
    of <em>both</em> Zend Framework <strong>2.0.7</strong> and <strong>2.1.0</strong>! Packages and installation instructions are
    available at:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/downloads/latest">http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    All existing users of ZF 2.0.x are encouraged to upgrade to 2.1.0; if you prefer 
    to only obtain fixes without new features, you may upgrade to 2.0.7.
</p><h2>2.0.7</h2>

<p>
    This is the last scheduled release in the 2.0 series, and contains over 150
    bugfixes. <a href="/changelog/2.0.7">Read the changelog for the full set of 
    improvements</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Many thanks to all the contributors who helped polish this initial feature
    branch and improve it!
</p>

<h2>2.1.0</h2>

<p>
    <strong>2.1.0</strong> is the first new feature release for ZF2. Most
    features are incremental improvements on existing components; we also
    have one brand new component as well. Things you'll see include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>New <strong>Zend\Permissions\Rbac</strong> component, providing
        Role-Based Authorization Controls. These complement our existing
        <code>Zend\Permissions\Acl</code> component, providing another
        mechanism for providing authorization for your applications.
        We have Kyle Spraggs to thank for this addition.
    </li>

    <li>New <strong>Zend\Test</strong> component, providing the ability
        to perform functional or integration testing on your ZF2 applications,
        courtesy of Blanchon Vincent.
    </li>

    <li>Support for <strong>Oracle</strong> and <strong>IBM DB2</strong>
        databases in <code>Zend\Db</code>. Many thanks to Ralph Schindler for
        spearheading these efforts.
    </li>

    <li>A new <strong>Zend\Stdlib\StringUtils</strong> class to provide unified
        functionality around manipulating strings, particularly those in multibyte
        character sets. Thanks to Marc Bennewitz!
    </li>

    <li><strong>scrypt</strong> support for <code>Zend\Crypt</code>.
        Thanks go to Enrico Zimuel for this addition.
    </li>

    <li>Apache <strong>htpassword</strong> support in <code>Zend\Crypt</code> 
        and in the <strong>HTTP</strong> authentication adapter; thanks go to 
        Enrico Zimuel again!
    </li>

    <li>New integration for handling and manipulating file uploads with the
        <code>InputFilter</code>, <code>Form</code>, and <code>Mvc</code> components,
        including capablities around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get">PRG</a>
        pattern. Please thank Chris Martin for his huge amount of work around this!
    </li>

    <li>A new <strong>render.error</strong> event, allowing you to fail
        gracefully in the event of a view rendering error. This allows you
        to present a static error page in such situations, as well as to
        log the problem. Thanks go to radnan for this addition.
    </li>

    <li>Additional integration between a variety of plugin managers and the
        service manager was created, covering form elements, filters, validators,
        route classes, and serializers; this allows application-level configuration
        of these plugin managers, providing a simplified interface for configuring
        custom plugins.
    </li>

    <li>Martin Meredith provided seven new <strong>traits</strong> for end-user use
        in PHP 5.4 applications.
    </li>

    <li>The <strong>Authentication</strong> component received support for 
        <strong>storage chains</strong> and <strong>validators</strong>.
    </li>

    <li>Better <strong>console</strong> support, including better help 
        messages, increased capabilities around colorisation, and more.
    </li>

    <li>Many incremental improvements in <code>Zend\Db</code>; in particular, 
        addition of <strong>profiling</strong> support, <strong>cross-table 
        select join</strong> support, <strong>derived table in select join</strong>,
        and <strong>literal</strong> objects.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Zend\Logger</strong> has new <strong>FirePHP</strong>, 
        <strong>ChromePHP</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and 
        <strong>FingersCrossed</strong> writers; thanks go to Walter Tamboer, 
        Jeremy Mikola, and Stefan Kleff.
    </li>

    <li>The <strong>MVC</strong> layer sports more flexibility and capabilities 
        in the AbstractRestfulController, including automated 
        content-negotiation for JSON requests, and support for most HTTP methods, 
        including OPTIONS and HEAD (and the ability to support arbitrary HTTP methods).
    </li>

    <li><strong>Zend\Session</strong> now has a <strong>MongoDB</strong>
        save handler, and provides <strong>better interoperability</strong>
        between sessions managed by ZF2 and 3rd party code.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    For the complete list of more than 140 changes, 
    <a href="/changelog/2.1.0">read the changelog</a>.
</p>

<h2>New Components</h2>

<p>
    In addition to the new components in 2.1.0, we have two new service 
    components to announce:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_Apple_Apns">ZendService_Apple_Apns</a>,
        which provides push notification capabilities for Apple iOS. This component may be installed
        via Composer or Pyrus.
    </li>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_Google_Gcm">ZendService_Google_Gcm</a>,
        which provides push notification capabilities for Google Android. This 
        component may be installed via Composer or Pyrus.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    I'd like to thank Mike Willbanks for the time and effort he put into these
    components, and for providing them to the project!
</p>

<h2>New Tooling</h2>

<p>
    Enrico Zimuel has been hacking on the <strong>ZFTool</strong> project, to provide
    tooling support for the framework. This has resulted in <a 
    href="https://packages.zendframework.com/zftool.phar">zftool.phar</a>, which provides
    the following capabilities at this time:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Skeleton application creation</li>
    <li>Module creation within a skeleton</li>
    <li>Autoloader classmap creation</li>
    <li>ZF2 installation to a directory</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Expect more capabilities in the future!
</p>

<h2>New Responsive Website</h2>

<p>
    Regular visitors to the website may notice some changes. Contributor Frank Brückner
    has been updating the site to implement a responsive design, provide more consistency
    between pages, and in particular, navigation, and over all make the site cleaner.
</p>

<p>
    The end result: the site should now be usable on a variety of platforms and 
    screen sizes, allowing you to visit on your desktop, tablet, or mobile phone!
</p>

<h2>Potential Breakage</h2>

<p>
    Both 2.0.7 and 2.1.0 include a fix to the classes <code>Zend\Filter\Encrypt</code>
    and <code>Zend\Filter\Decrypt</code> which may pose a small break for end-users.
    Each requires an encryption key be passed to either the constructor or the 
    <code>setKey()</code> method now; this was done to improve the security of each
    class.
</p>

<p>
    In 2.1.0, <code>Zend\Session</code> includes a new <code>Zend\Session\Storage\SessionArrayStorage</code>
    class, which acts as a direct proxy to the <code>$_SESSION</code> superglobal. The
    <code>SessionManager</code> class now uses this new storage class by default, in order
    to fix an error that occurs when directly manipulating nested arrays of <code>$_SESSION</code>
    in third-party code. For most users, the change will be seamless. Those affected will be
    those (a) directly accessing the storage instance, and (b) using object 
    notation to access session members:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
$foo = null;
/** @var $storage Zend\Session\Storage\SessionStorage */
if (isset($storage->foo)) {
    $foo = $storage->foo;
}
</pre>

<p>
    If you are using array notation, as in the following example, your code 
    remains forwards compatible:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
$foo = null;

/** @var $storage Zend\Session\Storage\SessionStorage */
if (isset($storage['foo'])) {
    $foo = $storage['foo'];
}
</pre>

<p>
    If you are not working directly with the storage instance, you will be 
    unaffected.
</p>

<p>
    For those affected, the following courses of action are possible:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Update your code to replace object property notation with array notation, OR</li>

    <li>Initialize and register a 
        <code>Zend\Session\Storage\SessionStorage</code> object explicitly with the 
        session manager instance.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Thank You!</h2>

<p>
    As always, I'd like to thank the many contributors who made these
    releases possible! The project is gaining in consistency and capabilities
    daily as a result of your efforts.
</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>
    Maintenance releases happen monthly on the third Wednesday; expect
    version 2.1.1 on 20 February 2013. The next minor release, 2.2.0,
    is tentatively scheduled for 24 April 2013.
