      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
    of three new releases: 2.1.4, 2.0.8, and 1.12.3!  Packages and installation 
    instructions are available at:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/downloads/latest">http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The ZF2 releases include three security updates, and all ZF versions also 
    include updates to the Twitter component to follow the Twitter v1.1 API, 
    which is not backwards compatible with previous versions.
</p><h2>Security Fixes</h2>

<p>
    2.1.4 and 2.0.8 contain three security fixes.
</p>

<h3>Query Route</h3>

<p>
    We were alerted to the fact that the Query route could override parameters
    matched in parent routes, effectively bypassing constraints defined. In
    particular, this could result in overriding the controller or action matched
    by a given route.
</p>

<p>
    The query route was deprecated, as a replacement exists within the HTTP router
    itself. You can pass a "query" option to the assemble method containing either
    the query string or an array of key-value pairs:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
$url = $router->assemble(array(
    'name' => 'foo',
), array(
    'query' => array(
        'page' => 3,
        'sort' => 'DESC',
    ), 
    // or: 'query' => 'page=3&sort=DESC'
));

// via URL helper/plugin:
$rendererOrController->url('foo', array(), array('query' => $request->getQuery()));
</pre>

<p>
    Additionally, the merging of query parameters into the route match was removed
    entirely. Please use the query container of the request object instead.
</p>

<p>
    For more information on the security vector, please see
    <a href="/security/advisory/ZF2013-01">ZF2013-01</a>.
</p>

<h3>Random Number Generation</h3>

<p>
    The <code>Zend\Math\Rand</code> component generates random bytes using the OpenSSL
    or Mcrypt extensions when available but will otherwise use PHP's
    <code>mt_rand()</code> function as a fallback. All outputs from <code>mt_rand()</code> are
    predictable for the same PHP process if an attacker can brute force
    the seed - which can be done if the attacker has access to a random number
    generated by `mt_rand` or the session ID (if generated without using additional
    entropy). 
</p>

<p>
    Zend Framework have revised the <code>Zend\Math\Rand</code> component to replace the
    current <code>mt_rand()</code> fallback for OpenSSL/Mcrypt with Anthony Ferrara's
    <a href="https://github.com/ircmaxell/RandomLib">RandomLib</a>, incorporating an additional
    entropy source based on <a href="https://github.com/GeorgeArgyros/Secure-random-bytes-in-PHP">source code published by George Argyros</a>. The new
    fallback collects entropy from numerous sources other than PHP's internal seed
    mechanism and extracts random bytes from the resulting mixed entropy pool.
</p>

<p>
    For more information on this security vector, please see
    <a href="/security/advisory/ZF2013-02">ZF2013-02</a>.
</p>

<h3>Database Platform Quoting</h3>

<p>
    Altered <code>Zend\Db</code> to throw notices when insecure usage of the 
    following methods is called: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>Zend\Db\Adapter\Platform\*::quoteValue*()</code></li>
    <li><code>Zend\Db\Sql\*::getSqlString*()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Fixed <code>Zend\Db</code> Platform objects to use driver level quoting when provided, and
    throw <code>E_USER_NOTICE</code> when not provided.  Added <code>quoteTrustedValue()</code> API for
    notice-free value quoting.  Fixed all userland quoting in Platform objects to
    handle a wider array of escapable characters.
</p>

</p>

<h2>Twitter API Updates</h2>

<p>
    Twitter has begun sunsetting its v1.0 API, and has introduced rolling 
    blackouts in order to prompt developers to move to the v1.1 API. 
    Unfortunately, v1.1 is not backwards compatible with v1.0, so a number
    of backwards-breaking changes need to be made.
</p>

<p>
    Version 2.1.0 of <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_Twitter">ZendService_Twitter</a>
    and version 1.12.3 of Zend Framework have been released with support for 
    v1.1 of the Twitter API. A number of service endpoints were removed, and others
    moved to new namespaces. As such, if you use the component, you are urged to upgrade,
    and we encourage you to read the documentation to see what methods are now available,
    and how to use OAuth access tokens with the service.
</p>

<h2>Polyfill Support Fixes</h2>

<p>
    Polyfills (version-specific class replacements) have caused some issues in 
    the 2.1 series for users of <code>Zend\Stdlib</code> and 
    <code>Zend\Session</code>.  In particular, users who were not using Composer 
    were unaware/uncertain about what extra files needed to be included to load 
    polyfills, and those users who were generating classmaps were running into 
    issues since the same class was being generated twice.
</p>

<p>
    New polyfill support was created which does the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>New, uniquely named classes were created for each polyfill base.</li>

    <li>A stub class file was created for each class needing polyfill support. 
    A conditional is present in each that uses <code>class_alias</code> to 
    alias the appropriate polyfill base as an import. The stub class then 
    extends the base.</li>

    <li>The <code>compatibility/autoload.php</code> file in each component affected was altered to trigger an <code>E_USER_DEPRECATED</code> error asking the user to remove the require statement for the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The functionality works with both Composer and ZF2's autoloading support, using
    either PSR-0 or classmaps. All typehinting is preserved.
</p>

      <title>Zend Framework 2.1.3 Released!</title>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2013 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>http://framework.zend.com/blog/zend-framework-2-1-3-released.html</link>
      <guid>http://framework.zend.com/blog/zend-framework-2-1-3-released.html</guid>
      <author>matthew@zend.com (Matthew Weier O'Phinney)</author>
      <dc:creator>Matthew Weier O'Phinney</dc:creator>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
    of Zend Framework 2.1.3! Packages and installation instructions are
    available at:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/downloads/latest">http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    This release has been pushed out quickly on the heels of 2.1.2 to fix an
    issue with autoloading PHP version-specific class implementations that was
    affecting PHP 5.3.3 users. Two other potential regressions were also
    addressed.
</p><h2>PHP 5.3.3 Users</h2>

<p>
    This release finally resolves issues with providing PHP version-specific 
    classes, specifically for PHP 5.3.3 users.
</p>

<p>
    If you are using <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> to manager
    your dependencies, a <code>composer.phar update</code> should resolve any
    issues.
</p>

<p>
    If you are not, you have two options.
</p>

<p>
    First, when starting new applications with the <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication">ZendSkeletonApplication</a>,
    class substitution will now happen by default.
</p>

<p>
    Otherwise, add the following lines to your <code>init_autoloader.php</code>
    file, as indicated by the comments below:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
// The following line should be on or around line 34:
if ($zf2Path) {
    if (isset($loader)) {
        $loader->add('Zend', $zf2Path);
    } else {
        include $zf2Path . '/Zend/Loader/AutoloaderFactory.php';
        Zend\Loader\AutoloaderFactory::factory(array(
            'Zend\Loader\StandardAutoloader' => array(
                'autoregister_zf' => true
            )
        ));

        // Add the following two lines:
        require $zf2Path . '/Zend/Stdlib/compatibility/autoload.php';
        require $zf2Path . '/Zend/Session/compatibility/autoload.php';
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Routing Fixes</h2>

<p>
    Two fixes to routing were made after discovering potential regressions.
</p>

<p>
    The first was to hostname routing. Changes were introduced in 2.1.2 to make 
    matching optional nested subdomains possible; unfortunately, this broke cases
    where the primary domain was specified. A fix has been included in 2.1.3 that
    fixes the regression (while simultaneously allowing the new behavior).
</p>

<p>
    A bug in console routing was also uncovered; camelCased or MixedCase options
    were allowed in route definitions, but route matching was normalizing options
    to lowercase, causing false negative matches. This was fixed for 2.1.3.
</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>

<p>
    Below are links to the issues addressed.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/issues/3714">3714: Zend\Stdlib\ArrayObject::offsetExists() returning by reference</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/issues/3855">3855: Fix #3852</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/issues/3856">3856: Simple route case insensitive</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Thank You!</h2>

<p>
    I'd like to thank those that tested the PHP 5.3.3 autoloading fixes, as well
    as Nick Calugar for providing the fix to hostname routing and Michael Gallego
    for the fixes to console routing.
</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>
    Maintenance releases happen monthly on the third Wednesday; expect version 2.1.4
    to drop 20 March 2013. We're also gearing up for version 2.2.0, which we are 
    targetting at the end of April 2013.

      <title>Zend Framework 2.0.7 and 2.1.0 Released!</title>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2013 22:55:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
    of <em>both</em> Zend Framework <strong>2.0.7</strong> and <strong>2.1.0</strong>! Packages and installation instructions are
    available at:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/downloads/latest">http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    All existing users of ZF 2.0.x are encouraged to upgrade to 2.1.0; if you prefer 
    to only obtain fixes without new features, you may upgrade to 2.0.7.
</p><h2>2.0.7</h2>

<p>
    This is the last scheduled release in the 2.0 series, and contains over 150
    bugfixes. <a href="/changelog/2.0.7">Read the changelog for the full set of 
    improvements</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Many thanks to all the contributors who helped polish this initial feature
    branch and improve it!
</p>

<h2>2.1.0</h2>

<p>
    <strong>2.1.0</strong> is the first new feature release for ZF2. Most
    features are incremental improvements on existing components; we also
    have one brand new component as well. Things you'll see include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>New <strong>Zend\Permissions\Rbac</strong> component, providing
        Role-Based Authorization Controls. These complement our existing
        <code>Zend\Permissions\Acl</code> component, providing another
        mechanism for providing authorization for your applications.
        We have Kyle Spraggs to thank for this addition.
    </li>

    <li>New <strong>Zend\Test</strong> component, providing the ability
        to perform functional or integration testing on your ZF2 applications,
        courtesy of Blanchon Vincent.
    </li>

    <li>Support for <strong>Oracle</strong> and <strong>IBM DB2</strong>
        databases in <code>Zend\Db</code>. Many thanks to Ralph Schindler for
        spearheading these efforts.
    </li>

    <li>A new <strong>Zend\Stdlib\StringUtils</strong> class to provide unified
        functionality around manipulating strings, particularly those in multibyte
        character sets. Thanks to Marc Bennewitz!
    </li>

    <li><strong>scrypt</strong> support for <code>Zend\Crypt</code>.
        Thanks go to Enrico Zimuel for this addition.
    </li>

    <li>Apache <strong>htpassword</strong> support in <code>Zend\Crypt</code> 
        and in the <strong>HTTP</strong> authentication adapter; thanks go to 
        Enrico Zimuel again!
    </li>

    <li>New integration for handling and manipulating file uploads with the
        <code>InputFilter</code>, <code>Form</code>, and <code>Mvc</code> components,
        including capablities around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get">PRG</a>
        pattern. Please thank Chris Martin for his huge amount of work around this!
    </li>

    <li>A new <strong>render.error</strong> event, allowing you to fail
        gracefully in the event of a view rendering error. This allows you
        to present a static error page in such situations, as well as to
        log the problem. Thanks go to radnan for this addition.
    </li>

    <li>Additional integration between a variety of plugin managers and the
        service manager was created, covering form elements, filters, validators,
        route classes, and serializers; this allows application-level configuration
        of these plugin managers, providing a simplified interface for configuring
        custom plugins.
    </li>

    <li>Martin Meredith provided seven new <strong>traits</strong> for end-user use
        in PHP 5.4 applications.
    </li>

    <li>The <strong>Authentication</strong> component received support for 
        <strong>storage chains</strong> and <strong>validators</strong>.
    </li>

    <li>Better <strong>console</strong> support, including better help 
        messages, increased capabilities around colorisation, and more.
    </li>

    <li>Many incremental improvements in <code>Zend\Db</code>; in particular, 
        addition of <strong>profiling</strong> support, <strong>cross-table 
        select join</strong> support, <strong>derived table in select join</strong>,
        and <strong>literal</strong> objects.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Zend\Logger</strong> has new <strong>FirePHP</strong>, 
        <strong>ChromePHP</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and 
        <strong>FingersCrossed</strong> writers; thanks go to Walter Tamboer, 
        Jeremy Mikola, and Stefan Kleff.
    </li>

    <li>The <strong>MVC</strong> layer sports more flexibility and capabilities 
        in the AbstractRestfulController, including automated 
        content-negotiation for JSON requests, and support for most HTTP methods, 
        including OPTIONS and HEAD (and the ability to support arbitrary HTTP methods).
    </li>

    <li><strong>Zend\Session</strong> now has a <strong>MongoDB</strong>
        save handler, and provides <strong>better interoperability</strong>
        between sessions managed by ZF2 and 3rd party code.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    For the complete list of more than 140 changes, 
    <a href="/changelog/2.1.0">read the changelog</a>.
</p>

<h2>New Components</h2>

<p>
    In addition to the new components in 2.1.0, we have two new service 
    components to announce:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_Apple_Apns">ZendService_Apple_Apns</a>,
        which provides push notification capabilities for Apple iOS. This component may be installed
        via Composer or Pyrus.
    </li>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_Google_Gcm">ZendService_Google_Gcm</a>,
        which provides push notification capabilities for Google Android. This 
        component may be installed via Composer or Pyrus.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    I'd like to thank Mike Willbanks for the time and effort he put into these
    components, and for providing them to the project!
</p>

<h2>New Tooling</h2>

<p>
    Enrico Zimuel has been hacking on the <strong>ZFTool</strong> project, to provide
    tooling support for the framework. This has resulted in <a 
    href="https://packages.zendframework.com/zftool.phar">zftool.phar</a>, which provides
    the following capabilities at this time:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Skeleton application creation</li>
    <li>Module creation within a skeleton</li>
    <li>Autoloader classmap creation</li>
    <li>ZF2 installation to a directory</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Expect more capabilities in the future!
</p>

<h2>New Responsive Website</h2>

<p>
    Regular visitors to the website may notice some changes. Contributor Frank Brückner
    has been updating the site to implement a responsive design, provide more consistency
    between pages, and in particular, navigation, and over all make the site cleaner.
</p>

<p>
    The end result: the site should now be usable on a variety of platforms and 
    screen sizes, allowing you to visit on your desktop, tablet, or mobile phone!
</p>

<h2>Potential Breakage</h2>

<p>
    Both 2.0.7 and 2.1.0 include a fix to the classes <code>Zend\Filter\Encrypt</code>
    and <code>Zend\Filter\Decrypt</code> which may pose a small break for end-users.
    Each requires an encryption key be passed to either the constructor or the 
    <code>setKey()</code> method now; this was done to improve the security of each
    class.
</p>

<p>
    In 2.1.0, <code>Zend\Session</code> includes a new <code>Zend\Session\Storage\SessionArrayStorage</code>
    class, which acts as a direct proxy to the <code>$_SESSION</code> superglobal. The
    <code>SessionManager</code> class now uses this new storage class by default, in order
    to fix an error that occurs when directly manipulating nested arrays of <code>$_SESSION</code>
    in third-party code. For most users, the change will be seamless. Those affected will be
    those (a) directly accessing the storage instance, and (b) using object 
    notation to access session members:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
$foo = null;
/** @var $storage Zend\Session\Storage\SessionStorage */
if (isset($storage->foo)) {
    $foo = $storage->foo;
}
</pre>

<p>
    If you are using array notation, as in the following example, your code 
    remains forwards compatible:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
$foo = null;

/** @var $storage Zend\Session\Storage\SessionStorage */
if (isset($storage['foo'])) {
    $foo = $storage['foo'];
}
</pre>

<p>
    If you are not working directly with the storage instance, you will be 
    unaffected.
</p>

<p>
    For those affected, the following courses of action are possible:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Update your code to replace object property notation with array notation, OR</li>

    <li>Initialize and register a 
        <code>Zend\Session\Storage\SessionStorage</code> object explicitly with the 
        session manager instance.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Thank You!</h2>

<p>
    As always, I'd like to thank the many contributors who made these
    releases possible! The project is gaining in consistency and capabilities
    daily as a result of your efforts.
</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>
    Maintenance releases happen monthly on the third Wednesday; expect
    version 2.1.1 on 20 February 2013. The next minor release, 2.2.0,
    is tentatively scheduled for 24 April 2013.

      <title>Zend Framework 2.0.4 Released!</title>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2012 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>http://framework.zend.com/blog/zend-framework-2-0-4-released.html</link>
      <guid>http://framework.zend.com/blog/zend-framework-2-0-4-released.html</guid>

    The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability
    of Zend Framework 2.0.4! Packages and installation instructions are
    available at:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/downloads/latest">http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest</a>
    </li>
</ul><h2>Changes</h2>

<p>
    ZF2 has shipped with two "view strategies" aimed at simplifying common use 
    cases around developing JSON and XML APIs: <code>Zend\View\Strategy\JsonStrategy</code> 
    and <code>Zend\View\Strategy\FeedStrategy</code>. Each of these would
    select an appropriate renderer based on one of the following criteria:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>If the view model present was of a specific type (e.g., 
        <code>JsonModel</code>, <code>FeedModel</code>).
    </li>
    <li>If the <code>Accept</code> header contained the appropriate media type.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This latter condition sparked some worry that, when enabled at the 
    application level (vs. enabled based on selected module, controller, action, or
    other more specific criteria), any endpoint could be forced to return JSON or Atom
    (based on the strategies registered), regardless of whether or not it was appropriate.
    This could lead to a couple bad situations:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Data present in the view model not intended for actual display now being displayed.</li>
    <li>Raising of exceptions due to insuitability of certain view variables 
        for serialization in the selected format (e.g., invalid feed data, 
        non-JSON-serializeable objects, etc.); this could lead to resource 
        consumption and potentially other vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Based on these concerns, we made the following changes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <code>JsonStrategy</code> and <code>FeedStrategy</code> now only ever select
        a renderer based on the current view model type: e.g. if you want to 
        expose something as JSON, you must return a <code>JsonModel</code>.
    </li>

    <li>Introduced a new controller plugin, <code>acceptableViewModelSelector()</code>.
        This helper can be used to select an appropriate view model if the <code>Accept</code>
        header meets criteria you specify.
    </li>
</ul>

As an example of the latter:

<pre class="highlight">
class SomeController extends AbstractActionController
{
    protected $acceptCriteria = array(
        'Zend\View\Model\JsonModel' => array(
            'application/json',
        ),
        'Zend\View\Model\FeedModel' => array(
            'application/rss+xml',
        ),
    );

    public function apiAction()
    {
        $viewModel = $this->acceptableViewModelSelector($this->acceptCriteria);
        
        // Potentially vary execution based on model returned
        if ($viewModel instanceof JsonModel) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    The above would return a standard <code>Zend\View\Model\ViewModel</code> instance
    if the criteria is not met, and the specified view model types if the 
    specific criteria is met. Rules are matched in order, with the first match "winning."
</p>
