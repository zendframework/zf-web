Zend Framework Website, v2.0
============================

This is the next incarnation of the Zend Framework website, written using ZF2.

Installation
------------

First step is grabbing dependencies. Run the following:

    php composer.phar install

At that point, you can test with the built-in webserver of PHP 5.4:

    cd public
    php -S localhost:8080

Alternately, configure a virtual host in the webserver of your choice.

Reference Guide
---------------

To configure the Reference Guide of ZF1 and ZF2, edit the file
``config/autoload/module.manual.global.php`` and modify the variables named
``$zf1ManualPath`` and ``$zf2ManualPath``, respectively. 

Each path is related to a specific language and version of the reference guide.
For instance, the English version of the 2.0 documentation is represented by:

    'zf_document_path' => array(
        '2.0' => array (
            'en' => 'path to /zf2-documentation/docs/_build/html/'
        )
    )

The path of ZF2 documentation must point to the contents of a documenation build
folder, generally found in ``docs/_build/html/`` of the [zf2-documentation project](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2-documentation); 
if you use the documentation distribution archives, you would simply point to
the directory in which you unpack the archive. The configuration paths must
end with the ``/`` (slash) character.

The 2.0 documentation files are generated using the
[Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) project. For more information on how to
generate the ZF2 documentation, read the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2-documentation/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file of the [zf2-documentation project](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2-documentation).

The path of the ZF1 documentation must point to the folder
``views/manual/$VERSION/$LANG/`` of the
``git://git.zendframework.com/zfweb-manual.git`` project, where ``$VERSION`` is
the version of Zend Framework, and ``$LANG`` is the language. As with the ZF2
configuration, the path must end with the ``/`` (slash) character.


Blog posts
----------

Want to post something on the blog?

Create a post in ``data/posts`` that returns a ``PhlyBlog\Model\EntryEntity``
(you can use an existing post as a template). Then, simply send a pull request,
and we'll review for inclusion.

To compile the blog, do the following from the root of the application:

```php
% php public/index.php blog compile -e -c -r
```

Then add and commit the new and updated files.

Generating Changelogs
---------------------

To generate the ZF1 changelog, execute the following:

```bash
% php public/index.php changelog fetch zf1
```

This will, by default, write to `data/zf1-changelog.php`. You will need to
ensure your local configuration includes appropriate JIRA credentials.

To generate the ZF2 changelog, execute the following:

```bash
% php public/index.php changelog fetch zf2
```

This will, by default, write to `data/zf2-changelog.php`.;
